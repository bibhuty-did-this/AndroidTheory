- Android is a linux based operating system

- Features of Android:
	1. Beautiful UI
	2. Connectivity
	3. Storage
	4. Media Support 
	5. Messaging
	6. Web Browser
	7. Multi-touch
	8. Multi-tasking
	9. Resizable Widget
	10. Multi-language
	11. GCF
	12. WiFi Direct
	13. Android Beam
	
- Andriod Architecture:
	1. Linux Kernel:
		- The bottom layer
		- Provides basic functionalities like Process, Memory and Device Management etc..
	2. Libraries:
		- On the top of linux kernel
		- WebKit, SQLite, SSL, libraries to play video and audio etc.
	3. Android Runtime:
		- Also on top of linux kernel
		- Key component is Dalvic Virtual Machine(similar to the JVM)
	4. Application Framework:
		- On the top of Libraries and Android Runtime
		- Provides servies in terms of classes which is used by developers
	5. Applications:
		- On the top of Application Framework
		- Games, Contact Book, Browser etc.
		
- Application Components:
	- Essential building block of Android Devices which are losely coupled in `AndroidManifest.xml`
	- Four main components are:
		1. Activities(a single screen with UI)
		2. Services(runs in the background to form long-running operations like playing music in background)
		3. Broadcast Rececivers(respond broadcast message from other applications or from the system like
							    the download is completed)
		4. Content Providers(supplies data from one application to other on request)
	- Additional components are:
		1. Fragements(behaviour of a portion of UI in an activity)
		2. Views(UI elements on screen such as Buttons, List Forms etc)
		3. Layouts(view hierarachies that control screen format 	& appearence of the views)
		4. Intents(messages wiring components together)
		5. Resources(external elements, such as strings, constants etc)
		6. Manifest(configuration file for the application)
		
- File folder description:
	- src(.java source file of the project)
	- gen(.R file, it references all the resources of the project)
	- bin(.apk file which is built by ADT)
	- res/drawable-hdpi(contains the list of drawable objects)
	- res/layout(contains files that define the UI)
	- res/values(xml file containing color, strings defn etc)
	- AndroidManifest.xml(defines fundamental characteristics of the app)
	
- MainActivity.java:
	- It is actual application file which ultimately gets converted to Dalvic executable and runs the application
	
- AndroidManifest.xml
	- Whatever component we develop as a part of the application, we must declare all its components in 
	  AndroidManifest.xml, which resides at the root of the application project directory.
	- This file works as an interface between Android OS and the application, so it is mandatory to declare the 
	  components in this file
	- The important tags of this file are: <activity>, <service>, <receiver>, <provider> etc.

- String.xml
	- Contains all the texts the application uses

- The R file:
	- It is a glue between acitivity java files like MainActivity.java and resource file like string.xml
	- It is a auto generated file which is not supposed to be changed by the user
	
- ActivityMain.xml(the layout file)
	- Contains the code for the layout of the application
	
- Different callback functions are:
	- onCreate()
	- onStart()
	- onResume()
	- onPause()
	- onStop()
	- onDestroy()
	- onRestart()
